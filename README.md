# Economics Time Series

## Problem Statement

The assignment involves modeling the price development of 20 statistically independent assets using a simple random walk without drift.

## Solution

### Summary
This script generates random walk data for 20 assets, plots the price developments, and visualizes the average investment capital. It provides insights into the risk associated with including more assets in a portfolio.

### How to Use
1. Run the script: `Assignment1GhazalehSafari.py`
2. View the generated plots for asset price developments and investment capital.
3. The script visually demonstrates that some assets are so risky i.e., they show much fluctuations and others have a monotone trend. Based on the problem, we defined them independent (i.e., without correlation). Therefore, increasing the number of assets will give us riskier portfolio. Hence selecting this method is not a good idea
